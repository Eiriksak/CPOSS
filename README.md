Here are the following things that needs to be downloaded on every VM in the cluster, including the master node and slave nodes. Assuming that the VMs are running Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
- Hadoop 3.1.3
- Spark 3.0.0
- Python 3.7.6
- Anaconda 4.5.11
- Install all the packages from `requirements.txt`

Each folder has a `README.md` file that further explains what the contents of that folder does.
